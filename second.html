<h3> As Gilligan swam through the floating water lilies, he couldnâ€™t help but notice the way the flowers parted before he even touched them. 
    The ripple from his wake reached them before he did, as if they were anticipating his arrival. The water lilies appeared to be untouched. 
    Not one was crumpled or out of place, almost as if he were the first to ever disturb their peace. The water was muddy and brown, yet the 
    lilies were as clean and vibrant as fresh laundry. There was a beautiful harmony to the way the flowers parted for his passage, then went 
    right back to their place as if he were never there at all. </h3>
