    <p>Welcome to the internet!
        Have a look around.
        Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found.
        We've got mountains of content.
        Some better, some worse.
        If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first.
        Welcome to the internet!
        Come and take a seat.
        Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet?
        There's no need to panic.
        This isn't a test, haha.
        Just nod or shake your head and we'll do the rest.

        Here's a nine-year-old who died.
        We got movies, and doctors, and fantasy sports.
        And a bunch of colored pencil drawings
        Of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other.
        Welcome to the internet!
        Hold on to your socks.
        'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock.
        They are grainy and off-putting.
        He just sent you more.
        Don't act surprised, you know you like it, you whore.
        See a man beheaded,
        get offended, see a shrink.
        Show us pictures of your children,
        tell us every thought you think.
        Start a rumor, buy a broom
        or send a death threat to a boomer
        or DM a girl and groom her,
        do a Zoom or find a tumor in your...
        Here's a healthy breakfast option.
        You should kill your mom.
        Here's why women never fuck you.
        Here's how you can build a bomb.

        Could I interest you in everything?
        All of the time?
        A little bit of everything
        all of the time.
        Apathy's a tragedy
        and boredom is a crime.
        Anything and everything
        all of the time.

        You know, it wasn't always like this.
        Not very long ago
        just before your time.
        Right before the towers fell, circa '99.
        This was catalogs,
        travel blogs,
        a chat room or two.
        We set our sights and spent our nights
        waiting
        for you, you, insatiable you.
        Mommy let you use her iPad.
        You were barely two.
        And it did all the things
        we designed it to do.
        Now look at you, oh
        look at you, you, you
        unstoppable, watchable.
        Your time is now
        your inside's out.
        Honey, how you grew.
        And if we stick together
        who knows what we'll do.
        It was always the plan
        to put the world in your hand.
        Hahaha.
